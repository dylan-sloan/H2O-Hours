# H2O-Hours
A python app to stay on top of your water drinking! Simply input an amount of time that you want to be reminded to drink water again, and voila! The program is made with kivvy and links to a quotes API that randomly selects a quote to input each time a reminder is set. The default sound is the airplane seatbelt sound, which is a soothing yet effective way to ensure your attention is caught.

## Motivation
In college, I would often go entire days without having water. Simply relying on tea and coffee to get through my day was not doing me any favors. I realized I needed to drink more water, but found that I kept forgetting
to do so! Being on my computer a lot, I figured that if I could make a program that runs in the background and reminds me when it's time to drink water, it would do me wonders. This is a program I have actually used
and has helped me to stay healthier during these times.
